Notes!

* Initial setup is with WSL.   Should run on anything yout python (in theory)
* However it gets Segmentation Fault errors in WSL.  Maybe SDL related?
* runs fine in Powershell though, but you'd wanna do the pip install first in the _To set stuff up_ section

To set stuff up

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
